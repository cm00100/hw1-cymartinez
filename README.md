# What was this project about? 

    The project was about making a web app by coding it on Cloud 9, storing it into Github, and making it viewable/useful by others 
    on Heroku.

# What was the learning objectives?
    
    The main learning objective was setting up a development environment using cloud tools. I learned how to use c9 without
    the use of a downloaded compiler, pushing my files to github, and deploying the files with heroku. I feel like these
    will be new crucial tools that I'll be using to create my work outside of school. 

# What are known problems, if any, with this assignment?
    
    One of the known problems is having your work saved all in the web. You don't need to save anything into your computer's
    local files with these tools. However, with the assignment, it's getting the hang of node.js and getting to know
    the commands. I believe this is normal for any first user.
    
# How would you improve it if you had more time?
    
    I'd spend time with the look of my web app, but I think it still looks nice with simple text and a cute graphic for now.
